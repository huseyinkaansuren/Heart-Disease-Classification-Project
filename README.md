# Heart-Disease-Classification-Project

This project classify people are if heart disease or not.

In this project Logistic Regression model used. For improving model I used Polynomial Features library. 

Projects train accuracy is %85 and cross validation accuracy is %84. With using polynomial features model improved to %88 train accuracy and %84 cross validation accuracy.

Precision Scores:
Non-poly Train Precision: 0.7
Non-poly CV Precision: 0.3

Polynomial Train Precision: 0.85
Polynomial CV Precision: 0.4

MSES: 

Non-poly Train MSE: 0.72
Non-poly CV MSE: 0.77

Polynomial Train MSE: 0.57
Polynomial CV MSE: 0.78

Libraries required for the project: Numpy -- Pandas -- os -- matplotlib.pyplot -- Seaborn -- sklearn.linear_model -- sklearn.metrics -- sklearn.model_selection

This project worked on Google Colaboratory. Data's directory should be changed.
